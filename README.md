Hi there
## Who am I

I'm Omokefe Ovie, A Tech Nerd, Ever since I came across this world of programming I never looked back I engaged myself in building projects as a way to solidify my understanding. All I do right now is building projects and getting a firm grasp on my Niche. I focus my energy on projects that affects us in the real world and try to stay on a project till perfection.

## Graduate from the never ending 'SelfTaught programming' University

Perhaps this has been the happiest choice of my life aside knowing Jesus (yup, I am a BELIEVER). Began my coding journey in 2019 and from one youtube video to another I have strive to get better daily in what I do. Began with python, but now I major on JavaScript, in all its might.

## What I'm good at

I have a good experience in both frontend and backend proramming. For the time being I am trying to unite my python skill to my javascript to become a better programmer and web developer. I build both frontend and backend codes for web and mobile development. ReactJS is my ciore strength, though I dabble into NextJs, but I stick with React most often. NodeJs for backend but dabble with python (Django) once in a while
