## 👋 Hi, I'm Omokefe Ovie!

### 🚀 Who am I?

I'm a passionate software developer with a relentless drive to build impactful solutions. Since diving into the world of programming, I've never looked back. Every line of code I write is part of a journey to deepen my understanding and perfect my craft. My focus is on building projects that solve real-world problems and staying dedicated until the solution is just right.

### 🎓 Lifelong Learner | Self-Taught Developer

I began my coding adventure in 2021, and since then, I've been sharpening my skills one project at a time. Starting with Python, I've since embraced full-stack development, and my expertise has grown to include multiple languages and frameworks. I strongly believe in continuous learning—after all, the journey in tech never ends! And yes, I'm also a believer in Christ, and my faith grounds me as I pursue my goals.

### 🔧 What I Do

I'm skilled in both frontend and backend development, specializing in building scalable, performant web and mobile applications. My frontend expertise lies in **React** and **Next.js**, with **Node.js** and **C#** handling the backend (though I still dabble with Solidity for web3). Now, I'm expanding my horizons with **Rust** and **C** to further strengthen my systems programming and backend capabilities.
